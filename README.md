# ChessSimplified
A chess project for and intro to java programming course!

# #Goal of project: 
To exemplify the use cases of oop in java through a chess game! Use of inheritance, overloading, overriding, etc are explored.

## How to run game?
1. Open project in your favorite IDE
2. Ensure Java is installed on your device
3. Run the GameApp file through the IDE
4. Enjoy!

## Rectrictions of the Game: 
Because chess is a very complicated game, there are a few resrictions in terms of rules in my version. Instead of the typical 'checkmate' the win condition of this chess game is to capture the other players king! I have future plans to update this and perhaps play around with some ML algorithms on the game if I get a chance.
